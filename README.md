Amendments and Landmark Court Cases. Majority of the test is this.

Marbury vs. Madison - Judicial Powers
Someone gave out a sealed letter about their job confirmation. They never got the letter. This could have been a scam to try and get the judicial job for more than one term.

Plessly vs. Fergusion - 1896 Segregation
This was the legalization of segregation. “One Drop Rule”. Louisiana was quite multicultural. Plessy wanted to improve the lives of others like him. Plessy’s committee went as far as to have a private detective arrest him so that they specifically challenged that specific segregation law. Challenged the case all the way to the Supreme Court. 
Start of Jim Crow Era.
70 years of segregation. 

//Brown vs. Board of Education - Segregation
Reconstruction Amendments, 13, 14, and 15th Amendment.
Happened in 1950’s, but the relevant laws were established in the 1930’s.
Linda Brown
It was a long process of enabling black students to attend schools with the proper resources for a quality education.


//Miranda vs. Arizona - Miranda Rights
People needed to be told their rights before going into arrest custody. I can see how some people may not know their basic rights.
The situation makes for easy police intimidation of the arrestee. The arrestee may admit to a crime they didn’t commit due to intimidation and/or not knowing their basic rights. They had the rights universally. I would say that some people may be new citizens and are unaware of their right to an attorney.

Roe vs. Wade - Abortion Rights (I’ve heard of this)
1973
The Abortion ban could hurt/kill the mother.

Obergefell - Hodges - Same Sex Marriage
Violation of 14th amendment, the equal protection clause. It enables same sex marriages.
Some states enabled it, some didn’t. With this case, it legalized same sex marriage in every state.

I need to know the Amendments.
1st Amendment - Free Speech. Congress can’t make a law that forces a citizen to respect an establishment (group of people or company), religion, or personal opinion. They can’t make a law that ‘silences the words’ of a citizen. They can’t limit what the press or the news says. They can’t stop people from gathering peaceably. They can’t stop the government from people petitioning for a government change.

2nd - Right to have weapons.

3rd - Government can’t forcibly house soldiers in private homes.

4th - Protects citizens from searching their homes and/or taking things.

(who wrote this quizlet? There’s a bunch of spelling errors.)

5th - Protects the rights of an accused person or group. They need to go through due process. (going to court)
6th - Right to a speedy and public trial (speedy as in the necessary time to get all the facts correct in the case.)

7th - Right to a trial by jury in civil cases.

8th - No cruel and unusual punishment

9th - People’s rights aren’t just limited to the Constitution and Bill of rights. They are afforded more than that.

11 - Individuals can’t sue a state.

12 - Separate Ballots for President and Vice President.

13th - no more slaves. Slavery Abolished.

14th - citizenship for former slaves. If you’re born in the US, you’re a US Citizen. 

15th Amendment - adopted in 1870 for the extended suffrage for African Americans (Black people can vote now and hold political office). Can’t prevent a person due to race, color or personal religion and opinion.

16th Income Tax. (This definitely needs to be changed. Taxes are way too high right now.)

18 Alcohol Prohibition

19th Amendment - Women can vote now.

20 Presidents take office on 20th of January

21 Prohibition was repealed. People can drink now.

Many amendments focus on rights of non-US citizens (focusing on making them citizens?)

Standard of Strict Scrutiny: cases that restrict fundamental rights to protected classes

Eminent Domain: lets the government take or use property for a public purpose.

Mapp v Ohio: Evidence without a warrant is not admissible.

Passed the US Constitution Pre-Assessment. I’ll have to review it at a later date.
Moving on to Physical and Human Geography.


Introduction to Physical and Human Geography – D199

Mikey: The course explores Climate Changes, the state of the world climate, current effects of climate change, potential solutions, and world politics in regards to each nation’s effect on the world climate.

“Chapter 1 in the study is the bulk of the OA so spend most of the time studying that chapter. Understand Climate Change, Different climate agreement like the Paris Climate Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol”

Climate Change
Shifts in temperature and weather patterns, likely referring to global climate change, but can also mean the climate change in a given continent or region.

Paris Climate Agreement
A science based legally binding agreement for all nations to work together to help reduce the negative effects of global climate change.

Kyoto Protocol
A United Nations Agreement to set emission targets and work to meet the targets.

Push and Pull Factors
Reasons an individual will immigrate to another country.

Understand the "Push and Pull" Factors which means what pushes people to leave countries and what brings them to different countries. Also know the different types of Maps and what they are used for.

‘On my 4th attempt now and also got told to study mostly all of chapter 1 and the first 4 lessons on each section, this is so difficult for no reason (I just barely failed my last attempt) after you take your 3 attempts you set up meetings with your instructor and they review part of section 1 with you and then your next meeting 2 and 3 and then one last meeting to review and touch up on anything before getting approval to take it again

EDIT 6/7 - finally passed it and my god this class was so frustrating, my advice is to focus mostly on the first 4 lessons of 1, 2, and 3 with the exception of reading all the lessons in section 1, definitely need to understand the types of migrations and conflicts, physical geography and the effects of climate change, definitely use the quizlet that is provided here on this Reddit but don’t use it as your main source, definitely read the sections over and over and do the study guide on sections 1 and 3 that the instructor is suppose to provide you.’

Mikey: You can study along with your Instructor? That’s cool.

Natural Science Lab – C683
Just a test of one’s understanding of the scientific method

I’m gonna cut several bananas differently. Assert that the bigger the cut, the faster the rate of decay from the point of incision in a 4 hour period. Easy.

‘I did mine on which microwave popcorn brand yields the least unpopped kernels. Seriously, do not overthink this. You are not working on an experiment to change the world. You only need a simple experiment to use as a basis to show you understand the principles of how to do the experiment. Google the old course name Integrated Natural Science experiment to find examples. You can definitely do this during a weekend.’

Web Development Foundations – D276
Mikey: read up on HTML and CSS.




Day 1:
I took the pre-assessment and failed by maybe 30 questions. Keep in mind you only need about a 50/70 to pass the OA. I may be slightly off, but those were my numbers.
Started by watching HTML Crash Course - Traversy Media | CSS Crash Course - Traversy Media
Really understand the concepts in these videos. They have the foundation you need to pass this class.
I took written notes on this Study Guide from page 1 to page 11. Reviewed most of the questions asked towards the end of the study guide. You don't need to be able to answer them all, however look over a few you find most important. THIS GUIDE HAS SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION!
After that I took the pre-assessment again and passed, but not by a lot.

Day 2:
I did the C779 Quizzets (there's also a tab for D276 class) only 3...one being foundations of HTML, foundations of CSS, and debugging.
I took the pre-assessment again and reviewed all the answers wrong and right. Passed again by a higher margin.

Day 3:
Booked the OA at 7:30AM. Drank some coffee and made myself a nice breakfast. Reviewed the study guide for maybe 5 minutes and took the test. The OA was more difficult than the PA by a bit. If you understand the HTML and CSS concepts you'll be fine. The test tries to trick you in a majority of questions, keeping your eyes peeled. Especially, when they give you line(s) of code. (Oh, so there’s code strings in there.)
Be on high alert and reread the questions multiple times. Ask yourself, "what are they looking for"? The test itself is only difficult because they really try to gauge if you know the knowledge by placing answer choices that seem to be right.
I spent around 14-15 hours studying. Most importantly, your work ethic will play a big factor. I was hungry to pass this class, more so when I saw other reddit posts saying they failed or passed by a small margin. These resources pretty much contain the majority of the information you'll need for the OA.

Technical Communication – D339
C768 Task 3 COMPLETE - C768/D339 Task 3 Section A: Email Write an email to your peers inviting them - Studocu

I think this is just a class on how to present information.
I’m gonna write a presentation on the best programming languages to learn.
Java
Python
C#
SQL
HTML/CSS

Maybe not languages.

White Paper? What’s that? Is that something the instructor hands to me?
Reading up on it. The examples online are about coding and/or some kind of software engineering related topic. Like a company or something.

Task 1 Writing a Powerpoint Video and recording it.
Task 2 Professional Email
Task 3 Watch 2 other videos and describe what they could have done better.


Additional Classes
I’ll add the classes when I’m done with the current terms. No use in stressing out by seeing the workload.

Pre-Program Thoughts
Feels like I’ve been studying up and getting ready for these classes since April of 2023. When I quit trucking.

Took a few certifications for this program. I’m looking good. I have all I need. Loads of gym equipment to stay fit, responsible spending habits, support from mom. I’m ready for this.


Looking to hit the ground running. Knock out these classes asap.
Seeing a lot of information online about how to get through this stuff as quick as possible.

Pre-Assessment Results
I see that I can review my assessment results. Very useful.

Studocu
What is this? This looks useful.

Pomodoro Technique, huh?
Study for an hour, take a quick workout and coffee break.




# Days.
Dec 27
So far it’s looking good. Using a version of the Pomodoro Technique. 45 minutes study, with 15 minute intervals. CJ and Jason do this all time.

If I don’t finish a course in 6 months, that’s grounds for expulsion or academic probation.

Web Foundations. I took the Pre-Assessment. Lots of CSS/HTML/XML. Gotta Review. Heavy on the HTML. I can study this.
Student Onboarding? It’s tomorrow. 4:30 or so. Gotta account for my time zone.
Huh. Health and Fitness popped up in my courses.

Transferred my notes over on to Github. This is all just on a wordpad, pretty much. Clean. Efficient.
...no. It needs to be a little bit prettier.
