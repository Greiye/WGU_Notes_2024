Study up. The needed speakers are coming in today.
Study habits are weak compared to how I first started out, but better than nothing.
Feeling Good.

Waiting on the external speakers that I need for test taking ( I know, weird.)
I think I'm ready to take the health and politics assessment.
I should write that natural sciences paper.

Hypothesis: A rotting open banana can spread to a closed banana.

Keep even unopen bananas away from rotting banana.
8hr experiment.

Noticable Study Habits.
45Mins/15 Minute break is ideal. Maybe I can stretch it out further more study time.
Deleting my games doesn't help. I still find a way to play games with friends. Exchange this for something better.

...
Passed Health and Fitness Exam.

American Politics was hard. It focused on more modern stuff.
I know i gotta study.

Tried taking the test yesterday. Didn't have the proper gear. Whack. Ordered it online. Should be test ready by tomorrow. Until then, more studies.

Feeling good, high moral.

Review of American Constitution.
Section 1: The Development of the Democracy.
Section 2: The Structure of the Government
Section 3: Political Participation ( How people get involved.)
Section 4: Civil Livberties and Rights: Everyone's rights.
Section 5: What the people see in politics

Federalists wanted a strong government because of the threat of organized Great Britain.
Anti Federalists didn't want to be governed by a large body due to corruption. They did, want strong state powers.

In Federalist no. 10, the diverse interest of citizens prevent the development of powerful interests.

The Major issue with the Articles of Confederacy is that they could not impose taxes. This meant no large treasury.

Officially Started WGU. 1115hrs.

First Up, American Politics.

<img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/uKwa2KiBA0rTy/200w.gif?cid=6c09b952g68v8u37vx4ucect4ip01c3m4gd1bln5chtn3f7a&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=200w.gif&ct=g?" width="25%" height="25%">

Purpose of a social contract is to acknowledge and protect natural rights

They say that you can see the effects of the Enlightenment Era in the Declaration of Independence.
Montesqeuieu?

Bicameral Legislature.

I see through Quizlet that the questions are going to be different and in different number compared to the pre-Assessment.

**Quizlet has a testing function. Super useful.**

The New Jersey plan.
Willian Paterson was involved.
It enabled every state to have one vote towards something.
At the time, it was a one chamber legislature. Unicameral.
The Supremacy Clause was the 'Law of the Land'.

This was against the Virginia plan, by James Madison.
It supposed for Three Branches of Government. and Two Chambers.
The House is elected by the people.
The Senate, appointed by legislature.
Votes based of Population.

The Great Compromise
had to do with slavery.

Federalists were supporters of the Constitution.
Anti-Federalists opposed the constitution, but did not necessarily want state sovereignty.

Federalist Paper 10
argued that factions were inevitable.

Quizlet also has Q-Chat. It's like texting a friend. It feels more organic. I like it.

The Electoral College selects the president and vice president based off of popular vote. Not really connected to voting districts or counties. ( I think)

a joint committee is a committee with the House of Representatives and the house Senate. it's created to work on issues that both of them have control over. Or affect both chambers.

Kind of having fun with the A.I. Algorithym in Quizlet.

1. Read the WGU Docs
2. Take the Notes and write them here (can't copy paste, as it doesn't help information retention.)
3. Paste these notes onto Quizlet for it's AI retention assistance
4. Take the Assessment.
5. 

There was a debate for ratification of the Bill of rights. some people opposed this. They were commited to the Declaration of Independence as is. They were known as the Anti-Federalists.

The Constitution was designed to keep factional powers in check with each other. It was a key consideration at the time of drafting the Constitution. Those who 'framed' the important topics of the Constitution drew inspiration from Montesquieu's principles.

The Enlightenment was the source of people's ideas about natural rights. it was a period following the middle ages.


Need to Review Lesson 3

Unicameral Congress has one chamber.

It made for two chambers: the Senators and the Representatives.

Each state was allowed only two members for the basis of representation under the Articles of Confederation.

Under the Articles of Confederation, the government can:
- Borrow and Coin Money from other nations.
- Declare war
- Make treaties and alliances
- Regulate tradw with natives
- Settle disputes between states.

Lesson 4.4 Questions.

Government at the time of writing the articles of confederation was limited because it was to prevent the government from becoming too powerful or abusing the rights of individual citizens.

The national government under the articles of confederation were limited to maintain the sovereignty of state governments.

the articles of confederation enabled the government to create an army and a navy.

The articles of confederation failed because they gave the states too much authority. They also severely  limited the powers of the government, making it weak and ineffective.

Too Much of one subject.

moving onto another one.

	<summary>29 December Notes</summary>
	<p>
		Studied up HTML and CSS Today. Whatever's on the Pre-Assessment.
		CSS: Padding values is Top Right Bottom Left in that order.
		Radio input types only allow for 1 selection/answer.
		Name attribute is used by all forms.
		it's specifically used to reference an element in Javascript.
		like for data entry forms, it's to use a reference for submitted data.

th - table header
tr - table row
td - table data, but can also double as table column.

browsers will find the index.html file in the root directory.

captions are optional in html.

html img uses src and alt. src to find the image source from the root directory of the html file, and alt to state in text what the image is. In the event the image fails to load.

External CSS lets an elements's style update from multiple pages from a single location.
Internal CSS is used for page-lebel style declaration.s

what tag is used to reference an external css sheet from within an HTML document?
link.

What style rule selects and formats childless paragraph element?
p:empty

What is that?

<!--
#one.two{
color:yellow;
}

<div id="one class="two> This should be yellow</div>
-->

is div, like a blank square on a web page? 

CSS classes can be used in Javascript.
Classes start with a period.
With that extrapolation, # Must be the start of an ID.

Selector Styles: ::first-letter
hmm. 

selector styles are patterns used to select the elements you want to style.

Are selector testers good for troubleshooting CSS issues? A kind of debugger?

2PM 29 DEC 2023
At this current time, I feel focused. Flow State. just trying to understand what I don't get.
W3 Schools has been a great asset in learning HTML.

XMP is Case sensitive and disallows errors.

div should be used when a developer needs to use a tag that doesn't apply a default format or style.

HTML is static, while XML is extensible.

. is for class
(#) is for id
: is a style selector.

~ generates sibling elements

styling float and clear are interchangeable with each other.

Responsive layouts

A Polygon hotspot begins and ends at the same pair of coordinates. They also contain many pairs of coordinates.

A text editor, any, is best for HTML.

padding with 3 values: it's top, both sides, then bottom.

(<div>)'s are usually used for page blocking.

knowing margin, padding, boarder and height/width is important. and what to do if you're getting 2-4 values.

Class: interchangable with Java Classes.

psuedo classes?
like with a:visited. That's a pseudo class?

Relative Lengths. I see this is important.

em is 2x the current font size
ex is the x-height
ch about width
rem is font size of the root element.
vw is viewport width
vh is viewport is height

this is important for window sizing and Responsive Layouts.

vmin is viewport minimum
vmax is viewport maximum.
% is the symbol for relativity to the parent element.

Good Day. Learned a lot.

Rendered Box model check for improper styling elements, rendering errors.

What is CDN? For Bootstrap?
Content Delivery Network

OMG. For WGU, You can only take the test Objective Assessments 3 times.
So I gotta be SURE that I get the material.

Did the Pre-Assessment.

<summary>American Politics and the US Constitution – C963</summary>
	
The Development of the Constitutional Democracy

Structure of the United States Government

Political Participation

Civil Liberties and Civil Rights

Public Opinion and Media

Amendments and Landmark Court Cases. Majority of the test is this.

**Marbury vs. Madison - Judicial Powers**
Someone gave out a sealed letter about their job confirmation. They never got the letter. This could have been a scam to try and get the judicial job for more than one term.

**Plessly vs. Fergusion - 1896 Segregation**
This was the legalization of segregation. “One Drop Rule”. Louisiana was quite multicultural. Plessy wanted to improve the lives of others like him. Plessy’s committee went as far as to have a private detective arrest him so that they specifically challenged that specific segregation law. Challenged the case all the way to the Supreme Court. 
Start of Jim Crow Era.
70 years of segregation. 

**Brown vs. Board of Education - Segregation**
Reconstruction Amendments, 13, 14, and 15th Amendment.
Happened in 1950’s, but the relevant laws were established in the 1930’s.
Linda Brown
It was a long process of enabling black students to attend schools with the proper resources for a quality education.


**Miranda vs. Arizona - Miranda Rights**
People needed to be told their rights before going into arrest custody. I can see how some people may not know their basic rights.
The situation makes for easy police intimidation of the arrestee. The arrestee may admit to a crime they didn’t commit due to intimidation and/or not knowing their basic rights. They had the rights universally. I would say that some people may be new citizens and are unaware of their right to an attorney.

Roe vs. Wade - Abortion Rights (I’ve heard of this)
1973
The Abortion ban could hurt/kill the mother.

Obergefell - Hodges - Same Sex Marriage
Violation of 14th amendment, the equal protection clause. It enables same sex marriages.
Some states enabled it, some didn’t. With this case, it legalized same sex marriage in every state.

I need to know the Amendments.

#### The 27 Amendments
	1st Amendment - Free Speech. Congress can’t make a law that forces a citizen to respect an establishment (group of people or company), religion, or personal opinion. They can’t make a law that ‘silences the words’ of a citizen. They can’t limit what the press or the news says. They can’t stop people from gathering peaceably. They can’t stop the government from people petitioning for a government change.
	
	2nd - Right to have weapons.
	
	3rd - Government can’t forcibly house soldiers in private homes.
	
	4th - Protects citizens from searching their homes and/or taking things.
	
	(who wrote this quizlet? There’s a bunch of spelling errors.)
	
	5th - Protects the rights of an accused person or group. They need to go through due process. (going to court)
	6th - Right to a speedy and public trial (speedy as in the necessary time to get all the facts correct in the case.)
	
	7th - Right to a trial by jury in civil cases.
	
	8th - No cruel and unusual punishment
	
	9th - People’s rights aren’t just limited to the Constitution and Bill of rights. They are afforded more than that.
	
	10 - Powers not in the Federal Declaration are reserved to the states. (States can have whatever rights that they all voted on, for that state.)
	
	11 - Individuals can’t sue a state.
	
	12 - Separate Ballots for President and Vice President.
	
	13th - no more slaves. Slavery Abolished.
	
	14th - citizenship for former slaves. If you’re born in the US, you’re a US Citizen. 
	
	15th Amendment - adopted in 1870 for the extended suffrage for African Americans (Black people can vote now and hold political office). Can’t prevent a person due to race, color or personal religion and opinion.
	
	16th Income Tax. (This definitely needs to be changed. Taxes are way too high right now.)
	
	17 Election of Senators
	
	18 Alcohol Prohibition
	
	19th Amendment - Women can vote now.
	
	20 Presidents take office on 20th of January
	
	21 Prohibition was repealed. People can drink now.
	
	22nd Amendment: The President can only serve 2 terms.
	
	23 Washington DC residents can vote for the president (Why wasn’t this given in the first place?)
	
	24 Can’t tax when doing polls (what?)
	
	25 Actions for the event that a president dies or resigns
	
	26 18 year olds can vote now
	
	27 Congress can’t accept a pay raise until the next term.


Someone on reddit finished this class in a week? It's not fair to compare myself to them. I finish this class when I finish it.

Pac and Super Pac? What is that?
PAC - Political Action Committee
Super PAC - Unlimited Amounts of expenditures

I’m very visual and kinesthetic. How do I apply this to the learning of the Constitution?

Factors that contributed to the government structure outlined by the Articles of Confederation:
Americans wished the government to be representative of the states.

Example of Congressional Allocation that influences the national budget to help a congressman’s district or state?
Funds that erect buildings in the congressman’s district

House Rules Committee; Determines the rules for debate and in what order to schedule consideration.

Executive Agreements is for establishing agreements with foreign countries without congress approval

What is Executive Privilege?
President can withhold information from courts and legislation

President can exert influence in the next president’s administration by having a budget that affects the incoming administration’s initiatives, whether good or bad.

Loose constructionist interpretation of the commerce clause

Presidential and Congressional Elections

How do states award votes in the electoral college?
Candidate who wins popular vote gets all the electoral votes.

12th Amendment makes a separate election for the president and vice.

Open Primary System: registered voters vote in any party during the primary

Campaign ads usually raise name recognition of a candidate

The Federal Election Commission was mainly for transparency.

Buckley v. Valeo: spending on political campaigns is part of First Amendment. (What? Why?)

Having a low income job is associated with being less likely to vote

1993 National Voter registration act lets citizens to register to vote when getting a driver’s license.

Literacy tests were once used to restrict African American votes

Plessy vs Ferguson: the 1/8th guy made an issue announced by highlighting that segregation was a broken system. ‘Separate but Equal’ is not equal.

6th Amendment: Right to a speedy trial. It affords right to an attorney.

Many amendments focus on rights of non-US citizens (focusing on making them citizens?)

Standard of Strict Scrutiny: cases that restrict fundamental rights to protected classes

Eminent Domain: lets the government take or use property for a public purpose.

Mapp v Ohio: Evidence without a warrant is not admissible.

6th Amendment also provides for individuals to question those who testify against them. It lets them call witnesses. (I thought it was for a speedy trial?)

5th Amendment: government needs to use fair and consistent procedures if they want to limit citizen’s rights or seize property

Brandenburg V Ohio: extends federal protection for abstract discussions of violence and government overthrowing (Insurrection)

Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby Stores
Businesses don’t have to provide birth control if it violates a business owner’s religious beliefs.

How did Civil War amendments affect individual rights?
Better rights for black americans.

Media Agenda setting:
Agenda determines with events deserve public attention

Principle of prior restraint?
Government can prevent information if it affects national security

Freedom of Information act: citizens can provide information requested by citizens

Radio Act of 1927: increased federal powers to regulate radio transmissions

Presidents use mandates after an election by using public support to implement campaign promises.

Justices not elected by appointed (by the president)

Income is a common demographic group.

Passed the US Constitution Pre-Assessment. I’ll have to review it at a later date.
Moving on to Physical and Human Geography.

	<summary>Introduction to Physical and Human Geography – D199</summary>
	Mikey: The course explores Climate Changes, the state of the world climate, current effects of climate change, potential solutions, and world politics in regards to each nation’s effect on the world climate.

“Chapter 1 in the study is the bulk of the OA so spend most of the time studying that chapter. Understand Climate Change, Different climate agreement like the Paris Climate Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol”

Climate Change
Shifts in temperature and weather patterns, likely referring to global climate change, but can also mean the climate change in a given continent or region.

Paris Climate Agreement
A science based legally binding agreement for all nations to work together to help reduce the negative effects of global climate change.

Kyoto Protocol
A United Nations Agreement to set emission targets and work to meet the targets.

Push and Pull Factors
Reasons an individual will immigrate to another country.

Understand the "Push and Pull" Factors which means what pushes people to leave countries and what brings them to different countries. Also know the different types of Maps and what they are used for.

‘On my 4th attempt now and also got told to study mostly all of chapter 1 and the first 4 lessons on each section, this is so difficult for no reason (I just barely failed my last attempt) after you take your 3 attempts you set up meetings with your instructor and they review part of section 1 with you and then your next meeting 2 and 3 and then one last meeting to review and touch up on anything before getting approval to take it again

EDIT 6/7 - finally passed it and my god this class was so frustrating, my advice is to focus mostly on the first 4 lessons of 1, 2, and 3 with the exception of reading all the lessons in section 1, definitely need to understand the types of migrations and conflicts, physical geography and the effects of climate change, definitely use the quizlet that is provided here on this Reddit but don’t use it as your main source, definitely read the sections over and over and do the study guide on sections 1 and 3 that the instructor is suppose to provide you.’

Mikey: You can study along with your Instructor? That’s cool.

<summary>Natural Science Lab – C683</summary>
	Just a test of one’s understanding of the scientific method

I’m gonna cut several bananas differently. Assert that the bigger the cut, the faster the rate of decay from the point of incision in a 4 hour period. Easy.

‘I did mine on which microwave popcorn brand yields the least unpopped kernels. Seriously, do not overthink this. You are not working on an experiment to change the world. You only need a simple experiment to use as a basis to show you understand the principles of how to do the experiment. Google the old course name Integrated Natural Science experiment to find examples. You can definitely do this during a weekend.’

	<summary>Web Development Foundations – D276</summary>

Mikey: read up on HTML and CSS.

Day 1:
I took the pre-assessment and failed by maybe 30 questions. Keep in mind you only need about a 50/70 to pass the OA. I may be slightly off, but those were my numbers.
Started by watching HTML Crash Course - Traversy Media | CSS Crash Course - Traversy Media
Really understand the concepts in these videos. They have the foundation you need to pass this class.
I took written notes on this Study Guide from page 1 to page 11. Reviewed most of the questions asked towards the end of the study guide. You don't need to be able to answer them all, however look over a few you find most important. THIS GUIDE HAS SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION!
After that I took the pre-assessment again and passed, but not by a lot.

Day 2:
I did the C779 Quizzets (there's also a tab for D276 class) only 3...one being foundations of HTML, foundations of CSS, and debugging.
I took the pre-assessment again and reviewed all the answers wrong and right. Passed again by a higher margin.

Day 3:
Booked the OA at 7:30AM. Drank some coffee and made myself a nice breakfast. Reviewed the study guide for maybe 5 minutes and took the test. The OA was more difficult than the PA by a bit. If you understand the HTML and CSS concepts you'll be fine. The test tries to trick you in a majority of questions, keeping your eyes peeled. Especially, when they give you line(s) of code. (Oh, so there’s code strings in there.)
Be on high alert and reread the questions multiple times. Ask yourself, "what are they looking for"? The test itself is only difficult because they really try to gauge if you know the knowledge by placing answer choices that seem to be right.
I spent around 14-15 hours studying. Most importantly, your work ethic will play a big factor. I was hungry to pass this class, more so when I saw other reddit posts saying they failed or passed by a small margin. These resources pretty much contain the majority of the information you'll need for the OA.

C768 Task 3 COMPLETE - C768/D339 Task 3 Section A: Email Write an email to your peers inviting them - Studocu

I think this is just a class on how to present information.
I’m gonna write a presentation on the best programming languages to learn.
Java
Python
C#
SQL
HTML/CSS

Maybe not languages.

White Paper? What’s that? Is that something the instructor hands to me?
Reading up on it. The examples online are about coding and/or some kind of software engineering related topic. Like a company or something.

Task 1 Writing a Powerpoint Video and recording it.
Task 2 Professional Email

Feels like I’ve been studying up and getting ready for these classes since April of 2023. When I quit trucking.

Took a few certifications for this program. I’m looking good. I have all I need. Loads of gym equipment to stay fit, responsible spending habits, support from mom. I’m ready for this.

Looking to hit the ground running. Knock out these classes asap.

Seeing a lot of information online about how to get through this stuff as quick as possible.

Pre-Assessment Results
I see that I can review my assessment results. Very useful.

Studocu
What is this? This looks useful.

Pomodoro Technique, huh?

Study for an hour, take a quick workout and coffee break.

	<summary>Dec 27</summary>
So far it’s looking good. Using a version of the Pomodoro Technique. 45 minutes study, with 15 minute intervals. CJ and Jason do this all time.

If I don’t finish a course in 6 months, that’s grounds for expulsion or academic probation.

Okay. Check out Health and Wellness.

## Health, Fitness, and Wellness - C458
Took the pre-assessment. Not hard. It's got intermediate health information. There's social wellness as well. But it had a bit about pronouns? hmm. I don't like that.

Advantageous Relative Location just means a resource that can be used for the subject's benefit.

Energy Losses are inevitable in an ecosystem cycle.

Weber beliebves that a business location is determined by labor costs.

Extreme natural boundaries often create neighboring lands with different cultures (take china and europe, with the mountain ranges and inhospitable area between them.

GDP (Gross Domestic Product) overlooks essential activities that do not involve money.

A country with too much national debt will incur currency inflation.

A Global governance aims to alleviate collective action problems.

The war in Syria affected Palestinian Migrants.

Time to study HTML/CSS/XML.
</details>

**HTML**
<details>
	<summary>**HTML**</summary>

```

<q>
<p><strong>The weather is hot.</strong></p>
<p><b>The weather is hot.</b></p>

<p><strong>The weather is hot.</strong></p>
<p><b>The weather is hot.</b></p>

These are acceptable ways to bold words.

<q> is quotations marks.
<p> is paragraph.
<br> is bring down to the next line.

it's 
<html>
 <head>
	 <title>
 </head>
<body> 
	<h1>Hello</h1>
	<p> This is it.</p>
</body>
</html>

<li> is list.
<ol>
	<li>Listy
	</li>
</ol>

Ugh. This is frustrating, garnering what the tags are off of the pre-assessment.
https://www.w3schools.com/tags/

All the tags.

HTML Tags.

ol is an ordered list.
This probably means that li is list item.

As of Dec 2023, HTML 5.2 Supports 142 HTML tags.
115 are still usable with previous HTML versions.

What is the difference with <h1 and <head?
is <title> the top tab title?

isn't _cite_ the same thing as italic?

<rubby ruby annotation
rt is 

</s is strikethrough
</u is underlined
</var is variable for math

</wbr is for long words. it's word break.

Semantic HTML 

HTML canvas. <canvas></canvas

<button>Click Me</button>
	
Details is for a drop down menu.
<details></details>

Drop down is super useful. ```
```
<q></q>
<!-- Span -->
<span>Loading:</span>
<progress id="file" value="32" max="100">
32%
</progress>

noscript if java app is broken

template to hide text when page loads

time tag
<dialog></dialog>
dialog box.

<input type="checkbox" />

All these concepts I've played with before, in different game engines.

<input list>

tf table footer
useful for making my own little spreadsheets.

image attributes
alt for text in case image doesn't show up.

Dec 29
Some of the material took in my mind.
I know about html attributes. styles. colors. It's all for text information. And I would believe some limited programming.

Style Attribute
Background Color
Color
Font-Family
Font-Size
Text-Align

Mikey: Randomly thinking about that one Markdown game and chatgpt.

there's 140 color names in HTML

Reminder: Hex color uses #FFFFFF. that's 3 values expressees through hexidecimal value. 

HSL is Hue Saturation and Lightness.

HSLA is the same but with alpha.

HTML Tables.
THis is useful for me.

tr table range
th header
td data

You can make HTMl tables pretty.
HTML Block

<div. I see this a lot. an element that's used as a container for other HTML elements.
div defines a section in a document. specifically for block-level.

span does the same, but inline.

q tag is not mark tag. mark is **marker**.

It's 
HTML
HEAD
BODY

in that one question, I used h1 instead of head.
</details>

<details>
	<summary>XML</summary>
eXtensible markup language
"XML Separates implementation from presentation."
- Stores and transport data.
- designed to be self-descriptive.

Has sender information
has Reciever information
a heading and body.

Application Programming Interface

YOu can make your own tags (Variables) in XML.

WWW Consortium 

XML Trees. hmmm.

Infered XML Schema. WHAT.

XML. Interesting.
